# Middleware Implementation for Logging and Bearer Token Authentication by VASU WATTS
Developed an Express.js server that demonstrates the use of custom middleware for efficient request handling and security. The first middleware function logs essential request details, including the HTTP method, request URL, and timestamp, enabling effective monitoring and debugging. The second middleware validates the presence of an Authorization header containing a Bearer token, ensuring that only authenticated requests are processed. This project highlights the importance of middleware in Express.js for maintaining structured request flow, enhancing server transparency, and implementing authentication mechanisms seamlessly.
